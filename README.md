<h1>Task 1 – Merge Sort</h1>

&#x25aa; Implement the following methods in the <strong>MergeSort.java</strong>:

<ol>

 <li>Method mergeSort()</li>

</ol>

This method uses divide-and-conquer to sort an array. It must use merge() method

<ol start="2">

 <li>Method merge()</li>

</ol>

This method merges two sorted subarrays <em>Reference: Lecture 5 Algorithms Part I, slide 20</em>

How to test your code?

Use the <strong>MergeSortTest.java </strong>file to check whether your implementation passes the test cases or not. It may be used as an indicator that your code is working correctly. Please be aware that we will use additional test cases to verify and assess your code.

What is tracker class?

The <strong>tracker.java </strong>is used for marking purpose to track divide-and-conquer calls. Do not modify any code associated with the tracker. Otherwise, you will be penalized for violation.

<h1>Task 2 – Karatsuba Multiplication</h1>

&#x25aa;  Implement the following method in the <strong>MultiplicationAlgorithm.java</strong>: 1.    Method KMultiply()

This method uses Karatsuba multiplication to compute the product x times y.

x and y are two n-digit input numbers <em>Reference: Lecture 5 Algorithms Part I, slide 49</em>

How to test your code?

Use the <strong>KMultiplyTest.java </strong>file to check whether your implementation passes the test cases or not. It may be used as an indicator that your code is working correctly. Please be aware that we will use additional test cases to verify and assess your code.

What is tracker class?

The <strong>tracker.java </strong>is used for marking purpose to track divide-and-conquer calls. Do not modify any code associated with the tracker. Otherwise, you will be penalized for violation.

<h1>Task 3 – Edit Distance</h1>

&#x25aa; Implement the following method in the <strong>EditDistance.java</strong>:

<ol>

 <li>Method minDistance()</li>

</ol>

This method computes the minimal total cost of a sequence of character edits between two strings.

The costs of character edits are defined in EditCost enum.

Do not modify the character edit costs. Otherwise, your answers will not be marked correctly. <em>Reference: Lecture 7 Algorithms Part III, slides 10-14</em>

How to test your code?

Use the <strong>EditDistanceTest.java </strong>file to check whether your implementation passes the test cases or not. It may be used as an indicator that your code is working correctly. Please be aware that we will use additional test cases to verify and assess your code.
